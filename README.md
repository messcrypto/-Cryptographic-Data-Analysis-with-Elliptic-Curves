# ECC-DataEncryptor

This project applies **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** in Python to protect sensitive data.  
It includes a modular cryptographic script that performs:
- Data encryption using ECC principles.
- Secure file handling.
- Future integration with data visualization.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `ecc_core.py`: Main encryption/decryption logic using ECC.
- `README.md`: Project description.
- `test_data.txt`: (Optional) Example data file to encrypt.

## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `ecc_core.py` in Python.
3. Input your data, and see it encrypted securely.

## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used
- Python
- Cryptography libraries
- (Optional) Matplotlib / Tkinter for GUI
