This project demonstrates basic cryptographic operations using **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** with Python. It simulates secure data handling and key generation techniques over the `secp256k1` curve.

## 🔒 What It Does
- Generates a private and public key pair using ECC
- Applies scalar multiplication over elliptic curve points
- Hashes text messages using SHA-256
- Demonstrates secure data encryption foundation

## 🧠 Why This Project?
This project reflects my academic background in mathematics and cryptography, and my passion for applying mathematical theory to real-world secure applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- SHA-256 (Hashing)
